The following books are suitable to get an introduction in the fields of Probability Theory and Statistics.&#x20;

* The first reference provides a very basic introduction needed to enter an introductory course in econometrics.&#x20;
* Ideally, more in-dept knowledge is required, and the second reference provides exactly that background (suitable for the regular track of the minor).&#x20;
* The third reference is very advanced (used during the BSc EOR and thus appropriate for the technical track of the minor).&#x20;

#### _The first book provides a short, concise and rigid introduction in econometrics based on matrix algebra. The second book provides exercises and solutions based on the material in the first book. Exercises are both theoretical and empirical, with support in RStudio:_
