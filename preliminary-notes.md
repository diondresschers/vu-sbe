**Topics to be covered:**\
\- Random variable vs realization, PDF, CDF, functions of a random variable\
\- Mean, variance, higher-order moments, quantiles\
\- Dependence, correlation, covariance, multivariate random variables (e.g. covariance and correlation matrix)\
\- Conditioning: conditional distributions, as well as the mean, variance and covariance operators, law of total expectation\
\- Hypothesis testing, p-values, confidence intervals\
\- Convergence in probability, convergence in distribution, law of large numbers, central limit theorem, asymptotic normality (-> approximate hypothesis testing)
