# ðŸ“™ Important concepts

It is generally difficult to define a complete profile in terms of background knowledge required for this minor. The teachers in this program have collected a list of topics in **statistics,** which they identify as crucial for a successful start into the first courses. It is advisable that you know about these concepts before you commence the minor.

* Random variables and realizations
* Probability distribution functions (PDF) and cumulative distribution functions (CDF)
* Moments: mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis&#x20;
* Quantiles of a distribution
* Covariance, correlation and dependence
* Multivariate random variables (covariance and correlation matrix)
* Conditioning: conditional distributions, conditional mean, variance and covariance
* Law of total expectation
* Inference: hypothesis testing, _p_-values_,_ confidence intervals
*   Asymptotics: convergence in probability, convergence in distribution, law of large numbers,

    central limit theorem, asymptotic normality&#x20;
