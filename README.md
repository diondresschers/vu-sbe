# ðŸ““ Preparation module

If you ended up here, you are probably thinking about studying the [Minor Applied Econometrics](https://vu.nl/en/education/minor/applied-econometrics-a-big-data-experience-for-all) (AE) at the [School of Business and Economics](https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/faculties/school-of-business-and-economics) of the [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/en). The minor AE has two different tracks, the _regular track_ and the _technical track_. You can read more about them [here](https://vu.nl/en/education/minor/applied-econometrics-a-big-data-experience-for-all/curriculum).

There are [prerequisites](https://vu.nl/en/education/minor/applied-econometrics-a-big-data-experience-for-all/admissions) in place for this study program. For the _regular track_, you should have completed your first courses in (introductory) mathematics and statistics. Pre-knowledge in programming is not mandatory, but might be desirable for a smooth start. In this module, we want to specify more clearly the concepts you need to be well-prepped for the minor. We will also provide you with references to reliable sources that can help you to refresh and practice your knowledge.&#x20;

This preparation module mostly focuses on prospective students that want to follow the _regular track_. If you are interested in the _technical track_, it is assumed that you either have a background in a BSc program in Econometrics or a related quantitative study. In that case, you should have followed courses that prepare you well for this minor.&#x20;

If you want to know more about the contents of the minor, please visit the [VU study guide](https://studiegids.vu.nl/en/#/). You can find more detailed information about the regular and technical track (and the different choices you can make). Moreover, you can read more about the courses and their specific contents.

We hope you'll enjoy the minor Applied Econometrics: A Big Data Experience for All!\
