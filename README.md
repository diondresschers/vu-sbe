# Minor Applied Econometrics: Preparation Module

If you ended up here, you are probably thinking about studying the [Minor Applied Econometrics](https://vu.nl/en/education/minor/applied-econometrics-a-big-data-experience-for-all) at the [School of Business and Economics](https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/faculties/school-of-business-and-economics) of the [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/en). As you can read on the website of the minor, there are [pre-requisites](https://vu.nl/en/education/minor/applied-econometrics-a-big-data-experience-for-all/admissions) in place for this study program. In particular, you should have completed your first courses in (introductory) mathematics and statistics. Even though it is not mandatory, some background in programming is also desirable.

In this module, we want to specify more clearly the concepts you need to be well-prepped for the minor. We will also provide you with references to reliable sources that can help you to refresh and practice your knowledge.\
\
**Topics to be covered:**\
\- Random variable vs realization, PDF, CDF, functions of a random variable\
\- Mean, variance, higher-order moments, quantiles\
\- Dependence, correlation, covariance, multivariate random variables (e.g. covariance and correlation matrix)\
\- Conditioning: conditional distributions, as well as the mean, variance and covariance operators, law of total expectation\
\- Hypothesis testing, p-values, confidence intervals\
\- Convergence in probability, convergence in distribution, law of large numbers, central limit theorem, asymptotic normality (-> approximate hypothesis testing)&#x20;
