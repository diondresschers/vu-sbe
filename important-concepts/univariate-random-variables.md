# â™¦ Univariate random variables

**Random variables** play a crucial role in econometrics. But what are they? Let's look at the two words separately.&#x20;

* A _variable_ is a quantity that can take on different values. However, these values are often pre-determined. For example, we can draw the curve that represents the function $$f(x)$$, if we decide beforehand what different values $$x$$ is allowed to take.&#x20;
* In contrast, this is not the case for _random variables_: the value that a random variable takes is the outcome of a **random event**. Imagine a referee tossing a coin before the match. We know that the two possible outcomes are "heads" and "tails", but we cannot tell the result with certainty before. Hence, there is some fundamental element of chance involved.

Random variables are often denoted by capital letters, e.g. $$X$$, and their outcomes, which we call **realizations** by lower case letters, e.g. $$x$$.  Suppose the referee gave you his coin and you wonder whether it is "fair". You know that for a coin to be fair, it should give the outcome "heads" $$(x=0)$$ in 50% of the cases and "tails" $$(x=1)$$ in the remaining 50% of the cases. To test whether this is indeed the case, you toss the coin $$n=100$$ times. &#x20;
