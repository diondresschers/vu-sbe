# â™  Multivariate random variables

As alluded to on the previous page, econometricians are often interested in the relationship between two or more random variables. Therefore, we need measures that give us insight into the **joint probability distribution** of these random variables.&#x20;

An important quantity is the **covariance**, which is a measure of joint variability between two random variables. The sign of the covariance (i.e. + or -) indicates whether the random variables generally move in the same or opposite direction. The interpretation of a covariance is generally not straightforward, because the values it can take are not bounded. For that reason, the measure **correlation** which only takes values between -1 and +1  is often preferred.&#x20;
